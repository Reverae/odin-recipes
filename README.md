# odin-recipes

This is my first proper odin project, ermmm....project.
I am going to create a very minimalistic website consisting of a main index page with links to some recipes. It will look plain but will be used in later CSS projects. 

I will also be setting up a GitHub repo and using git throughout the project. 

I hope to increase my understanding of both basic html and VCS via Git.

I will reflect on the project using this README after completion.
